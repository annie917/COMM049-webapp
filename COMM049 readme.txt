COMM049 Coursework - Anne Alexander

Tested in Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Safari.

The project uses div for elements that are purely there to act as Bootstrap containers, but meaningful elements for everything else.

The project gets live weather data from Yahoo weather's API.  This one was chosen because it serves over https and does not require an 
API key.  If for any reason the call to this API fails, sample weather data to demonstrate the svg graphics is provided, 
along with a warning message.

The project uses a combination of Bootstrap and media queries for the responsive design requirement.
